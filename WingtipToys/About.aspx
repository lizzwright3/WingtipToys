    <h2><%: Title %> Wingtip Toys.</h2>
    <p>Wingtip Toys was founded in 1973 by John Doe. Mr. Doe grew up in a military family, so his family was always
        on the move. Due to this he became interested in different types of transportation at an early age. He came
        up with the idea for Wingtip Toys when he was a teenager and decided to start his own business.</p>
